	<h3><a href="assign1/index.html">Assignment 1</a></h3>
	<p>Assignment 1 introduces students to the basics of the HTML and CSS to design a personal website upon which succeeding assignments will be built.  A second apsect of this assignment is to set up the file structure correctly on a server that will host the website. </p>
	<p>This assignment was not as easy as I expected.  I thought there would be a couple of issues with positioning, and I was right.  The positioning elements can behave very unexpectedly when you don't know exactly how they interact.  To this point I've used Bootstrap for styling and didn't realize how much it handled.  I spent way too long trying to get the positioning of the elements to work right.  I'm not sure if my solution was a best practice, but I'll need to put a more concertive effort into the CSS to HTML relationship.</p>

	 <h3><a href="assign2/index.html">Assignment 2</a></h3>
	 <p>Assignment 2 centered around forms, user input, and an introduction to javascript.  The students were tasked with developing a form using text boxes, radio buttons, dropdown lists, and checkboxes that would collect user input.  The input was then processed using javascript to produce an output to the user.</p>
	 <p>This was a touch assignment for me.  I might have bitten off more than I can chew.  I realized how much I don't know and how difficult it is to design a good web page without setting up some solid css for the scructure.  The javascript is frustrating because there tend to be a lot of syntax errors and reference errors when developing javascript.  Hopefully, the "ah ha" bell will go off soon.</p>

	<div class="assignment">
	<h3><a href="assign3/index.html">Assignment 3</a></h3>
	<p>Assignment 3 further covers javascript.  The purpose of the assignment is to take user input, a list of numbers, and perform multiple mathmatical computations on the list.</p>
	<p>This is the first assignment where we separate the javascript into a separate file.  Once you get one function to get the user input, process it, and return back to the main page to display, the other functions were easy.  This assignment also pointed out the advantages and efficiency of designing code for reuseability.  Many of the calculations used a simpler computation as a part of it.</p>
	<p>My design skills still suck.  I tried to make some changes to the css and html tables but didn't make any new headway.  CSS is massive, and even javascript offers numerous ways to do something.  The issue arises is that if you haven't developed a "blueprint" for the layout of your page, you can run into problems accomplishing what you want.  For now, no "ah ha" moment yet.</p>

	<div class="assignment">
	<h3><a href="assign4/index.php">Assignment 4</a></h3>
	<p>Assignment 4 is about PHP and server side scripting.  The first part of the assignment required us to create a login page that redirects the user to their administration page if they provide the proper credentials.  At this stage of the learning process, we were not required to incorporate a database to store the login credentials. </p>
	<p>The second part of the assignment required us to develop a stock tracker that could have the basic CRUD functions performed on it.  The user would be able to add a stock and a desired number of shares.  The program would use a link to yahoo finance that would retrieve the price at the time the addition takes place and record it.  Options to modify the number of shares and delete a stock from the portfolio were also required.</p>
	<p>I've had some experience with php, but I've never dealt with saving information to a flat file and using that as a sort of &#147;database&#146;.  It was challenging for me.  Once you get the syntax to work though, it is a standard format.  Although PHP is a good server side language, the user doesn't have a great experience having to deal with page reloads for every action.  And enclosing html tags within echo statements is a pain as well.  It's so easy to miss something and not know what you missed, because debugging php is cumbersome at best.</p>

	<div class="assignment">
	<h3><a href="assign5/index.php">Assignment 5</a></h3>
	<p>Assignment 5 continued to cover server side scripting with php.  This week also introduced the class to the database and developing applications that perform CRUD functions with a database.  Our task this week was to create a table using MySQL and then develop an application that allowed the user to interact with the database and either add, edit, list, or delete records from the database.  We were free to develop any scenario we wanted as long as it met the requirements.</p>
	<p>This project was probably the funnest for me even though it was tough.  I generally try to shy away from intermingling php within html unless it's just to include a file in a page such as a header.  But it is hard not to do that.  The answer most people will give is to just use javascript, ajax, or something else and stay away from php.  I have to say that I like php though.  It really makes it so that you can modularize your application componenets and communicate with a database easily.  With that said, programming is still incredibly frustrating.  I spent 3 hours trying to figure out why a procedure wasn't working the way I wanted it to only to finally see that it was a missing bracket.  Uggghhhh!  So frustrating.  How much longer do we have to wait until we just tell a computer our ideas and it will make our program on the spot?</p>

	<div class="assignment">
	<h3><a href="assign6/index.php">Assignment 6</a></h3>
	<p>Assignment 6 served as a continuation to assignment 5 by introducing us to AJAX or asynchronous javascript and xml.  It is widely used because it provides a better experience for the user.  While the scope of the this project was considerably smaller than previous assignments, I had the usual technical issues that have plagued me all semester.  I had a particularly difficult time capturing the selected option.  I received undefined functions and values when debugging in Firebug.  Thank you to Stackoverflow.com.  I used to hate that site but it's been a savour this semester. </p>
	<p>I also had a tough time structuring my query correctly to get results from the database.  Took awhile to get done what I did.  I would have liked to have created a multi-selection filter but couldn't get it to work, yet.</p>
