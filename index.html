	<p>Assignment 1 introduces students to the basics of the HTML and CSS to design a personal website upon which succeeding assignments will be built.  A second apsect of this assignment is to set up the file structure correctly on a server that will host the website. </p>
	<p>This assignment was not as easy as I expected.  I thought there would be a couple of issues with positioning, and I was right.  The positioning elements can behave very unexpectedly when you don't know exactly how they interact.  To this point I've used Bootstrap for styling and didn't realize how much it handled.  I spent way too long trying to get the positioning of the elements to work right.  I'm not sure if my solution was a best practice, but I'll need to put a more concertive effort into the CSS to HTML relationship.</p>
